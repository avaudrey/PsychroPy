    in Â°C and pressure in bar. Although three parameters, as e.g. temperature
    (T), relative humidity (R) and pressure (P) are required to identify the
    specific state of any moist air, pressure will be implicitly considered as
    equal to its default value, i.e. 1 atm, until a different value is
