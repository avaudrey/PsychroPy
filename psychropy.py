    Object containing the state of a given moist air. Temperature is expressed
    in Â°C and pressure in bar. Although three parameters, as e.g. temperature
    (T), relative humidity (R) and pressure (P) are required to identify the
    specific state of any moist air, pressure will be implicitly considered as
    equal to its default value, i.e. 1 atm, until a different value is
    specifically entered as an attribute. A couple of parameter as e.g. RT, RW,
    TW, can then be used to enter the specific state of the air (as it is used
    for example in CANTERA) with:
        R = relative humidity
        T = dry bulb temperature
        W = specific humidity or humidity ratio
        B = wet bulb temperature
        D = dew point temperature
        H = specific enthalpy
